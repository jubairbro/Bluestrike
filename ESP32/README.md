### üì± How to Flash Using Only a Mobile Phone (Android)

You can compile and upload this firmware using your Android phone.

**Step 1: Install ArduinoDroid**
- Go to the Google Play Store and install the **[ArduinoDroid - Arduino/ESP8266/ESP32 IDE](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=name.antonsmirnov.android.arduinodroid)** app.

**Step 2: Setup ESP32 Support in ArduinoDroid**
- Open ArduinoDroid.
- Go to **Menu (‚ò∞) > Settings > Board type > ESP32**.
- Tap on `esp32` by `Espressif Systems` and wait for the board definitions to be downloaded and installed.

**Step 3: Install Required Libraries**
- You need the `ESPAsyncWebServer` and `AsyncTCP` libraries.
- Go to **Menu (‚ò∞) > Libraries > Manage Libraries**.
- Search for and install the following libraries:
    1.  `ESPAsyncWebServer` by `me-no-dev`
    2.  `AsyncTCP` by `me-no-dev`

**Step 4: Load the Code**
- Copy the entire code from the `Sensi_Deauth_Panel.ino` file provided above.
- In ArduinoDroid, open the editor (the main screen).
- Paste the code, replacing any default code.

**Step 5: Connect and Flash**
1.  Connect your ESP32 board to your Android phone using the Micro-USB cable and the USB-OTG adapter.
2.  A popup might appear on your phone asking for permission for ArduinoDroid to access the USB device. Grant it.
3.  In ArduinoDroid, go to **Menu (‚ò∞) > Settings > Board type > ESP32** and select **"ESP32 Dev Module"**.
4.  Click the **Compile** button (checkmark icon ‚úîÔ∏è) at the top. It should compile without errors.
5.  Click the **Upload** button (down arrow icon ‚¨áÔ∏è) to flash the firmware to your ESP32.
6.  You can monitor the upload process in the console output at the bottom of the screen.

### üöÄ How to Use the Sensi Deauth Panel

1.  **Power On:** Power your flashed ESP32 using any USB power source (like a power bank or charger).
2.  **Connect to WiFi:** On your mobile phone, open your WiFi settings. Find and connect to the network named **`Sensi Deauth Panel`**. There is no password.
3.  **Open Control Panel:**
    -   After connecting, your phone should automatically detect the Captive Portal and show a "Sign in to network" notification. Tap it.
    -   If it doesn't open automatically, open your mobile browser (Chrome, Safari, etc.) and navigate to the address `192.168.69.1`.
4.  **Operate from the Panel:**
    -   **To Scan WiFi:** Tap the `Scan WiFi Networks` button. The log will show the progress, and the dropdown list will be populated with nearby SSIDs.
    -   **To Deauth:** Select a network from the dropdown and tap `Start Deauth`. The attack will begin. Tap `Stop Attack` to end it.
    -   **To Jam Bluetooth:** Tap `Start BLE Flood`. Tap `Stop Attack` to end it.
    -   Monitor the `Live Logs` box for real-time feedback on all actions.

That's it! You now have a fully portable network testing tool.
